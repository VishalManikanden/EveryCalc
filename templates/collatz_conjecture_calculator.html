    <h5 class="info-title">What is the Collatz Conjecture?</h5>
    <p>The Collatz Conjecture (also called the 3n + 1 problem) looks at numbers getting stuck in infinite loops. The problem states that for any positive integer,
    if the integer is even, halve the number. If it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process for every resulting number, and eventually,
    the numbers will get stuck in a loop. For example, take the number 5. Since this is odd, multiply it
    by 3, and add 1, which becomes 16. Since 16 is even, divide it by 2, resulting in 8. Divide it again, which results in 4, which becomes 2 and then 1.
    Then, since 1 is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1, which results in 4. This then becomes 2, and then 1 once again. The Collatz Conjecture is that
    every positive integer will eventually get stuck in this infinite loop. However, this conjecture has never been proven. This calculator calculates the number
        of steps needed to reach 1 the first time. For example, for the number 5, it took 5 steps to reach 1.</p>
